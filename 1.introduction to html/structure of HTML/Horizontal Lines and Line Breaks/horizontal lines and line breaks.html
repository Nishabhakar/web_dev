        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br /><br /> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br /> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br /> <br />It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br />remaining essentially unchanged.<br /><br /> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br /> and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br />Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br />
